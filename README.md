# HMS-PROJECT
This is my first Gui based project which is on Hospital Management System and with a database connection.
For database i have used sqlite3. 

Program includes :
1.Login to the system
2.Creation of appointments
3.Adding those appointments to the database
4.Updating or Deleting those appoinments

You can update,delete or search records by using your name or else by PID no (patient id) as there can be similar records.
It also shows total number of appointments done.
And login is done using the username and password which is specified already in the code.

To run the program you have to first create database table in sqlite3. You have to create 2 tables for no of appointments and for patient details.


Thankyou!!
